# Bayesian_Seminar
Repository for the code associated with my Seminar in Econometrics (a Bayesian class) term paper.
Could the code in this repository be written in a cleaner maner? Well, yeah for sure! As a relative novice programmer in any language, including R I wrote it this way (step by step) so I know exactly what the code is doing and so I have a pretty good idea of where I went wrong when an error occurs.
